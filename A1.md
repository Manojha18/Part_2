First Application: Google Art and culture
Link to application: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=google%20art%20and%20culture%20app&c=apps&hl=enType of Application Type: Education

History got its new shape and was discovered once again with Google’s effort to exhibit the beauty and value of art and culture which was preserved for centuries. This app is a retreat for any aesthete who is yearning for momentous details and views about past centuries.

In this contemporary world, people have hands on experience on evolving technologies but has least access with monuments, artifacts, historic movements, museums etc. In order to overcome the existing gap this app gives an opportunity for users to experience cultural heritage through High definition artwork with precision, 360-degree video, street view, virtual reality tours, helps to locate nearby cultural events, scrutinize by time and color, matching our selfie with artworks, photo series etc.

Technologies used: 
Coded gaze: biased facial recognition technology – selfie feature
Virtual reality
Google street view
360-degree VR

Advantages
1.	Search for details are based on various categories like medium, color and time, period, places, collections, themes etc.
2.	Gives real time experience for users like visiting famous and influential arts and culture using various technologies. 
3.	A present for any art fanatic and a student with art and science major due to its immense collection.
4.	Tremendous facts, myths, details and opinion gathered from 70 countries which gives diverse experience about culture.
5.	People are curious to find their doppelganger from the past centuries so there is a higher possibility that the user will learn about the personalities with whom they resemble. 

Improvements
1.	Since flooded with immense information it seems to be inconvenient for users to refine their search, higher possibility to get distracted.
2.	It does not attract users due to the absence of gist in articles.
First Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall
Are objects, actions and options visible? (Observed)
The search option, home, explore, nearby places and favorites are the view icons that are always visible which helps the user to navigate through various topics and refine the search. Due to which the user will have a quick access to commute through the app.

Second Heuristic Evaluation: Flexibility and efficiency of use
 Accelerators(observed)
Highlights, categories, collections, popular topics.

Are such accelerators provided for expert users to carry out task more quickly? (Observed)
Highlights – Gives app highlights like art camera, 360-degree video, virtual reality tours and street view. We can choose from any of these and distill our search.
Categories – Can be searched based on artists, medium, art movement, historic events, historical figures and places. Provides easy access to any of the articles.
Collections – gives information and details about 1000 museums worldwide
Popular topics – presents all those famous articles and stories.

Second Application: Photomath
Application type: Education
Link to application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microblink.photomath&hl=en
Math seems to be a nightmare for most of the kids who are struggling to solve equations. Photomath turns math to be fun and interesting by capturing the printed or handwritten equation and solving it step by step along with formulas and ending with a graph. 

Using photomath, one does not need a math tutor for primary and secondary grade school students to explain formula and methodologies involved in solving the problem. The detailed explanation provides insights to solve distinct problems with similar logics. Thereby, infusing problem solving appetite at younger age.
Unlike other math apps which requires users to type complex equations, Photomath uses Optical character recognition which reinforce the purpose for which augmented reality is used. OCR and AR together improve the quality of information gathered from the object that is scanned; recognizes the mathematical pattern and converts it into computer readable format. This app is built on real-time text recognition software named microblink.  The technologies incorporated in this app overcomes the confusion and misrepresentation of questions when typed i.e. misplacing variable, numbers, exponents, superscripts and subscripts etc.

Advantages
1.	Minimal design makes it easier for users to move around different activity which supports effective usage.
2.	Free step by step explanation promoting greater understanding of concepts, whereas in other app detailed explanation is a paid feature.
3.	 Autodetection in camera captures and recognizes the text quickly and presents the solution immediately.
4.	 Keeps track of solved problems and also has an option to share the knowledge with friends.
5.	Blink OCR technology detects the hand-written equations.

Disadvantages
1.	Higher level of mathematical equations cannot be solved but the team is working on updating it.
2.	Even though, the app does not support some complex problems it captures the problem and solves it in an incorrect manner.
3.	Sometimes it fails to detect the variables and numbers in precise manner thereby giving away a wrong solution.

Improvements
1.	If the smart camera does not detect the exact equation an error message can be displayed to explain the why it is not detected.
2.	Another error message for equations and topics that is not covered in the app instead of displaying some quirky solutions.
First Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world

Is the language used is simple? (Observed)
Since the app is developed for school going students the language used is plain and    straightforward. It also has “how to use” feature which explains users how to scan, look for step by step information, to alter the questions and to examine the graph in a student understandable language.

Are the phrases, concepts used familiar to the user? (Observed)
The description in the app includes familiar topics like arithmetic, trigonometry, fractions, exponential and logarithmic functions, roots, algebraic expressions etc. User will already have an idea about what will be explained in the app. So, they do not have inconvenience in understanding the concepts and words being used.


Second Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design

Is any unnecessary and irrelevant information provided in the webpage? (Observed)
The app itself is made of minimal and essential design. It contains very few view tabs which satisfies the exact purpose of the application. For example, it consists of editor window, smart calculator, solution tab, notebook, language, help and feedback and about Photomath and do not have any redundant or useless options, views or tabs.
